# COSC 2430 REVIEW

## 1. Graph 15% No Programming

* BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim
  * Extra function to traverse BFS and DFS (optional)
    * DFS(Stack) and BFS(Queue) traversal

## 2. Trees 25%

* Traversal, rotations (single or double), balancing, insertion(coding), BST, AVL(insert and remove), B Tree
  * Short answer (Height of the tree?, Depth of a tree?)

## 3. Stacks 10%

* Coding, traversal, reverse, combination of list and stack, queue and stack
  * Writing a function (do not write the class stack)

## 4. List 20%

* Coding, traversal
  * Writing a function: insert, delete, search
    * Singly, doubly, circular
      * Bubble, insertion, (shell, bucket, quick, merge => complexity)

## 5. Queues 10%

* Coding, traversal
  * Insert, delete, search
    * Combining queue with another structure

## 6. General Question / Short Answers 10%

* Big O, True/False, Comprehensive about all structures

## \*Sorting may be in General Questions or implement sorting in data structures. Function recursive and non-recursive
